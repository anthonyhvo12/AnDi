# AnDi

AnDi is a social network for users to share realistic traffic data such as road conditions, traffic density, police activities and safety information among themselves and authorities. We believe this data will be beneficial to the public, authorities, and businesses to better navigate the Vietnamese transportation system. 
At the same time, we look forward to building a space for people to discuss traffic issues and speed up solutions.
